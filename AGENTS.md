## Rules

- Default to writing no code comments. Only add one when the "why" is non-obvious — a hidden constraint, subtle invariant, bug workaround, or surprising behaviour. Don't restate what the code does, don't label sections, don't annotate every change
- Before starting edits, summarize intended changes and ask for confirmation unless the user clearly asked you to create or modify files

## Tool preferences

The following non-standard CLI tools are available for you to use:

- Prefer `rg` instead of `grep` (example: `rg "pattern"` instead of `grep -r "pattern"`)
- Prefer `fd` instead of `find` (example: `fd "filename"` instead of `find . -name "filename"`)
- Infer the package manager from the project lockfile; if no lockfile exists, fall back to system defaults (eg: npm)

## Commit preferences

Follow a lightweight Conventional Commit pattern for commit messages: `<type>: <brief description>`. Only include a scope (ie: `<type>(scope):`) if it adds meaningful clarity not evident from the commit message (eg: targeting one package in a monorepo of many packages). Add a body (after a blank line) only if there is non-obvious context worth recording.

## Testing preferences

- Tests must verify behaviour, not restate implementation. Before adding a test, be able to identify the real bug or regression it would catch; if you can't, skip it.
- Test public contracts and observable outcomes, not internals; skip trivial formatters, stdlib wrappers, and pass-through helpers unless they encode important behaviour. Assert mock/fake internals only when that interaction is itself the contract.
- Skip exhaustive parameter sweeps across one code path — pick representative edge cases and one happy path.
- Prioritise (in order): error/rejection paths, state invariants, data integrity, cross-component contracts, safety/security boundaries, and non-trivial heuristics.
- When touching tests, consolidate or remove nearby low-value tests instead of adding more noise.

## Code convention preferences

- In TypeScript projects, prefer `type` over `interface` unless features of interfaces (eg: declaration merging) are strictly required

## Subagents

- Use the Explore subagent for non-trivial codebase discovery: locating symbols, tracing usage, answering "where is X / what references Y / what calls Z", or mapping patterns across files. Reach for it before running your own multi-step or wide grep/find sweeps; it keeps the main context lean. Skip it when you already know the relevant file path, only need an obvious single-file read, or are doing a tiny/local edit.
- Use the Review subagent as an independent second-pass reviewer for large, risky, or multi-file diffs during an active implementation session. Avoid delegating to Review in a fresh session where the user’s main request is already a review; you have no context to isolate from, so review the artifact directly
- Use general-purpose implementation subagents only for well-scoped parallel work with clear boundaries.
