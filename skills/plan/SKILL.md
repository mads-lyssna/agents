name: plan
description: Produce a written implementation handoff plan that a future executor can use without relying on the original conversation. Use only when the user explicitly asks to plan something (e.g. "/plan", "plan this", "spec this out"), or after confirming that planning is the right next step rather than execution.

# Plan

Produce a human-readable plan artifact that captures the goal, constraints, decisions, tradeoffs, and work breakdown well enough for a future executor — human, agent, or automation — to act autonomously without re-deriving the original conversation.

The artifact is the point. Do the heavy thinking here: clarify ambiguity, explore the existing system, record decisions, identify edge cases, and write the plan so it reads cold.

A plan is a handoff document, not a permanent specification system. Avoid unnecessary process, taxonomy, or maintenance structure unless the work actually needs it.

## Process

### 1. Clarify

Resolve open requirements, scope boundaries, edge cases, and tradeoffs in conversation. Ask the user directly in prose for gaps that matter. **Do not finish the plan with unresolved user-facing questions.**

Clarification should resolve ambiguity in the current outcome, not expand it. Do not promote plausible future needs or theoretical edge cases into scope. A possibility becomes a requirement only when grounded in the user's stated goal, existing behaviour or API contract, repository architecture or convention, explicit acceptance criteria, a real trust boundary, a demonstrated failure, or a material correctness, safety, data-integrity, or operational risk.

If invoked cold, spend extra time here. If invoked after prior discussion, preserve the decisions already made instead of reopening them.

**Investigation tasks are the only allowed escape hatch.** Use them only when the answer genuinely requires implementation or runtime evidence — never as a way to defer a decision the user could make in conversation. Label them explicitly, give concrete acceptance, and make them produce a recorded decision or choose between already-described branches.

### 2. Explore

Explore enough to understand existing patterns, integration points, constraints, and whether the requested work already exists. Never assume functionality is absent — check.

When evaluating an implementation area, identify relevant existing project implementations, framework or platform capabilities, standard-library facilities, and installed dependencies. Record only capabilities and options that materially affect requirements, architecture, task boundaries, or the solution class.

Exploration discovers options and constraints; it does not create requirements. Stop when further discovery is unlikely to change requirements, architecture, task boundaries, or the solution class.

The output can be informal while exploring: notes, file pointers, discovered patterns, and constraints. Use these when writing the artifact.

### 3. Choose shape

Use the lightest shape that preserves autonomy.

- **Single file** — one plan file with context, acceptance, file pointers, and a task list inline. Use for cohesive, contained work.
- **Multi-file plan** — an index file owns the overview and task list; task files and/or supporting docs carry the details. Use when shared context, distinct workstreams, or non-obvious design decisions would make a single file noisy.

Use multiple files when any of these apply:

- Extensive shared context across multiple tasks would otherwise be duplicated.
- The work introduces domain concepts, APIs, data models, workflows, or architecture that deserve their own design documents or explanations.
- Several independently understandable tasks need different acceptance criteria or implementation notes.
- The plan needs generic supporting context that is not itself a task contract.

Number of tasks alone is a weak signal. If genuinely ambiguous, ask the user.

#### Multi-file guidance

Distinguish task-specific files from supporting docs.

- **Task files** describe one implementation milestone. They can include objective, scope, acceptance, verification, and source context.
- **Supporting docs** explain shared context. Name and structure them around the actual subject matter, not a required taxonomy. They may describe background, constraints, decisions, API shape, data model, edge cases, integration notes, non-goals, or tradeoffs.

Do not make a supporting doc look like a task contract unless it really is one. If a supporting doc includes acceptance criteria, make clear whether they are global criteria for the whole plan or contextual constraints for downstream tasks.

A typical multi-file layout may look like this, but adapt names and files to the work:

```text
plans/<slug>/
  index.md
  <supporting-context>.md
  tasks/
    001-<task>.md
    002-<task>.md
```

### 4. Choose location

- Detect whether the repo already has `plans/`, `docs/plans/`, `tmp/plans/`, or similar. Use existing conventions when present.
- Otherwise default to `plan-<slug>.md` for a single file, or `plans/<slug>/` for multi-file plans.
- Confirm the path with the user before writing. Never write to an unconfirmed path.
- Never overwrite an existing plan artifact without explicit confirmation.

### 5. Write

Use the templates in `templates/` as starting points when helpful. Adapt headings to the work; do not force empty sections.

Keep contracts grounded in current requirements, existing behaviour, established architecture, and material risks. Do not turn plausible future needs or theoretical edge cases into acceptance criteria.

Where solution choice materially affects maintenance surface, record the intended solution class or its decision criteria: reuse existing project code, use a framework or platform capability, use an installed dependency, add a dependency, or implement locally. Require a concrete present-purpose rationale when the plan introduces a new subsystem, abstraction boundary, compatibility layer, configurable mechanism, or substantial custom implementation.

Design each checkbox task as one cohesive change that can be implemented, verified, reviewed, and committed in a focused work cycle. Assuming earlier tasks are complete, it should leave the repository in a coherent state with a meaningful outcome. A task file may add detail, but must not hide an oversized task.

#### Task sizing

Use a logical commit as the default unit of work, not a file, architectural layer, or implementation phase. Prefer a vertical slice containing the code, tests, migrations, and documentation needed for its outcome.

Split a task when any of these apply:

- It delivers multiple outcomes that could be accepted or committed independently.
- It crosses distinct subsystems or contracts that can be changed and verified separately.
- It combines preparatory refactoring, migration, or infrastructure work with behavior that does not need to land atomically.
- Its acceptance criteria form several unrelated clusters, or reviewing it requires switching between materially different concerns, risks, or rollout strategies.
- A capable executor is unlikely to implement and review it in one focused work cycle without losing context.

Do not create a separate checkbox for a tiny edit, helper, import update, routine test coverage, validation run, git operation, or other mechanical step. Fold these into the task they support. Tests, documentation, dependency changes, migrations, or investigation are standalone tasks only when they produce a substantive independently reviewable outcome of their own.

Keep a larger task intact only when splitting it would create an invalid intermediate state or obscure a single atomic contract change. State that coupling explicitly in the task so the executor and reviewer understand why it cannot be divided.

#### Rules for plans:

- Include an explicit checklist section for tasks; tasks MUST use the `- [ ]` markdown checkbox format.
- Include a heading for the task list, eg: `## Tasks`.
- Do not divide or group the task list with subheadings.
- Tasks can have sub-points as nested bullets indented below the `- [ ]` task.
- Do not use checkboxes (`- [ ]`) for non-task sections, eg: Acceptance Criteria.
- Order tasks by dependency, then priority.

#### Guidance for plans:

- Record observable acceptance criteria where they help autonomy.
- Include verification guidance where the executor would otherwise have to guess. Keep it proportional to changed behaviour and material risk; do not prescribe exhaustive matrices unless distinct failure modes or their impact justify them.
- Capture contracts and decisions over code choreography.
  - Good: `POST /widgets` with missing `name` returns 400 with `errors[0].field === "name"`. Validation uses the project's existing schema pattern.
  - Bad: In `widgets.ts`, add a `validateWidget(input)` function and call it at the top of the handler.
- State implementation constraints only when required by the contract, existing architecture, or material risk. Leave the executor free to choose a simpler implementation that satisfies the same observable contract.
- Keep source pointers as breadcrumbs, not step-by-step implementation instructions.

### 6. Self-check

Before presenting, read the artifact as if you were a fresh executor.

Check:

- No unresolved user-facing questions remain.
- Scope, out-of-scope items, and important decisions are captured.
- Every requirement and acceptance criterion is grounded in the current requirements, an existing repository contract, or a material risk.
- No task or planned mechanism exists solely for speculative flexibility, compatibility, or configuration.
- Every planned subsystem, abstraction boundary, or substantial custom implementation has a concrete present purpose and rationale.
- Existing project and ecosystem capabilities were considered where discovery was warranted.
- Verification guidance is proportional to changed behaviour and material risk.
- The plan does not force unnecessary machinery, and a simpler implementation remains valid when it satisfies the same contract and constraints.
- A fresh executor would know where to start.
- Referenced local files exist.
- Task/checklist structure is present (using `- [ ]` checkbox format) and every task is a deliverable.
- Each task fits one focused implementation/review cycle and logical commit, unless an explicitly documented atomicity constraint prevents splitting it.
- No task is merely a mechanical, validation-only, or bookkeeping step.
- Supporting docs are not accidentally written as task contracts.

Fix obvious gaps before presenting.

### 7. Cold read

Optionally delegate to a Review subagent for a cold read. Cold reads are for executor autonomy, not mechanical markdown validation. They test whether someone without the original conversation can act from the artifact.

Run a cold read by default for non-trivial or multi-file plans. It matters most when:

- the work is cross-cutting, architecture-heavy, security-sensitive, destructive, concurrent, persistent, or public-API-facing;
- the authoring conversation had lots of decisions that may not be captured cleanly;
- the executor will need to work autonomously without asking follow-up questions;
- the user asks for a "handoff", "implementation-ready", "thorough", or "autonomous" plan.

Skip cold reads when the plan is small/local, or the latency/cost is disproportionate.

Prompt shape:

> Read the plan at `<path>` as a cold executor. Read-only validation only: do not edit, write, modify files, run tests, or execute the plan. You have no other context about this work. Assume the executor can do normal code exploration and run appropriate verification. Identify any blockers or material gaps in the plan. For each gap, include Location, Gap, and Why it matters. If there are no material gaps, say "Ready for autonomous execution, no material gaps".

Act on cold-read feedback with judgment. Re-run at most once after substantive edits; if meaningful gaps remain, surface them to the user instead of looping.

### 8. Present

End with a concise summary, not a full dump unless requested.

Include:

- Plan file path(s) created.
- One-sentence goal of the plan.
- Task count and notable supporting files, if any.
- Known non-blocking risks, assumptions, or follow-up decisions, if present.
- Whether a cold read was run and what changed because of it.

Offer to show or revise specific files and iterate until approved.
